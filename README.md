#House Price Prediction using Ridge & Lasso Regression
This project aims to predict housing prices by employing Ridge and Lasso regression techniques. the .ipynb file contains the detailed implementation, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

Overview
The repository includes a comprehensive analysis of the housing dataset, with a focus on feature selection and regularization to enhance the modelâ€™s performance. The Ridge and Lasso regression models are fine-tuned to predict prices accurately, addressing overfitting and ensuring generalization.
