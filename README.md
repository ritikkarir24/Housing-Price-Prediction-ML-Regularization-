# House Price Prediction using Ridge & Lasso Regression
This project aims to predict housing prices by employing Ridge and Lasso regression techniques. the .ipynb file contains the detailed implementation, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

# Overview
The repository includes a comprehensive analysis of the housing dataset, with a focus on feature selection and regularization to enhance the model’s performance. The Ridge and Lasso regression models are fine-tuned to predict prices accurately, addressing overfitting and ensuring generalization.
